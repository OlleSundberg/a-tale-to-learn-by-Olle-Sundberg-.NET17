Once upon a time there was a small village called flatworm.
Flatworm had a spell on it where people would never get fat.
One day a woman was banned because she tried to take the spell just for herself.
After some time in the forest she found something that would give her powers, but the item
was evil and the price was growing hair nonstop for ethernity.
