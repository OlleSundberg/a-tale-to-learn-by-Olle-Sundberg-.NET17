Here he is. The one who can save the poor village. It's mr Hero!
Mr Hero is a young 5 year old prince with a red cape looking for an adventure so he can prove his worth to the local princess.
Behind his shadow jumps out his sidekick. A incredible, brave and ferous chihuaua.
He proudly carries his mighty candy-sword that he got from his father right before he passed away.
